# GeneralizedCoherentPointDrift

Code implementation of CVPR 2022 paper "Coherent Point Drift Revisited for Non-Rigid Shape Matching and Registration"

# Usage

We have provided an example with tuned initialization and parameters for GCPD in Example.m. Directly running Example.m would give the result of Fig.1 in the paper.
